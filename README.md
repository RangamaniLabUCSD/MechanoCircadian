# MechanoCircadian
MATLAB-based implementation of the coupling between the cell Circadian clock and mechanotransduction.

The code in this repo is split into 3 categories:
* MechanoOnly: functions used to model YAP/TAZ and MRTF-based mechanotransduction
* CircadianOnly: delay differential equation-based model of Circadian oscillations
* MechanoCircadian: Coupled model of YAP/TAZ and MRTF nuclear translocation leading
    to changes in the expression of Circadian proteins
